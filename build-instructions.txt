./build is the standard location for temporary build files

** WINDOWS special **
The very first time you clone the project from git, you also need to download
our external dependencies
in directory "external" run
fetch_downloads.bat (or .sh)
then
extract_downloads.bat (or .sh)
Now you have all the items you need to build corinthia.
*** END ***

We depend on cmake to generate the target build system
in ./build do:
cmake -G "<build>" ..
where <build> is one of
Visual Studio 10 2010 = Generates Visual Studio 10 (VS 2010) project files.
Visual Studio 11 2012 = Generates Visual Studio 11 (VS 2012) project files.
Visual Studio 12 2013 = Generates Visual Studio 12 (VS 2013) project files.
Visual Studio 14 2015 = Generates Visual Studio 14 (VS 2015) project files.
Unix Makefiles = Generates standard UNIX makefiles.

Other build directories is possible.
Other <build> is possible but not tested
